<em>Audio Effects is an ecommerce application offering a hand-selected catalog of guitar effects pedals. Visit the shop page to view all of the available pedals, or click on a category in the navigation bar to narrow down your search. While browsing through the shop you can also filter the effects catalog by brand. If you already know which effect you are looking for you can type it's name in the search bar and select it from the drop down list. Click on any product to view more details, or add/remove it from the cart by adjusting the product quantity using the arrow buttons. The shopping cart can be accessed by clicking the cart icon available on each product and in the top right hand corner of the naviation bar. </em>

This application is a part of The Odin Projects Full-Stack Javascript curriculum and was developed with the purpose of practicing state management and routing in React. The main challenges I faced were learning how to use React's context API to manage state, setup routing for a single page application, customize a component library using a css-in-js solution, and deploy a project using Netlify.
