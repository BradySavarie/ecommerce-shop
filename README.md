This application is a part of The Odin Projects Full-Stack Javascript curriculum and was developed with the purpose of practicing state management and routing in React. The main challenges I faced were learning how to use React's context API to manage state, setup routing for a single page application, customize a component library using a css-in-js solution, and deploy a project using Netlify.
